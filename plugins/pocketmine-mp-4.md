title: PocketMine-MP 4 Plugins by KygekTeam
---

The first public version of PocketMine-MP 4 has been released on December 1st, 2021 after years of PocketMine-MP 4 development. This means that PocketMine-MP 3 will be no longer supported after a while. We want to provide the best service for everyone, one of which is by providing an update for a newer PocketMine-MP version before anyone needs it. That's why we starting to update all of our existing plugins to be compatible with PocketMine-MP 4 before the PocketMine-MP 3 official support comes to an end.

Plugins listed below are ready to be used for production servers, but like all software, they may contain minor bugs. If you happen to find one, please submit an issue in the GitHub repository of the plugin you're facing with.

### NOTE:

Please look at the API version in the plugin's `plugin.yml` file to ensure compatibility with newer or older PM4 variants. This is **important** to note because as of PM4, they sometimes make API changes in minor version updates. Our PM4 plugins API follows the PocketMine-MP API versioning guidelines, which means plugins for older PM4 minor versions (e.g. `4.0.0`) should work in newer versions (e.g. `4.2.0`), but not the other way around. We never use patch versions as the API version unless it's necessary, which is rare to come across anyway. If we decided to bump the API version to a newer PM4 minor version, compatibility with older minor versions will automatically be lost. However, we will try to keep support for older minor versions as long as there's a good reason to still doing it.

For more information about PocketMine's API versioning, please see [this documentation](https://doc.pmmp.io/en/rtfd/developer-reference/api-version-spec.html).
