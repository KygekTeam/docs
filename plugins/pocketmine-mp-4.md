# PocketMine-MP 4 Plugins by KygekTeam

**Last updated: December 3rd, 2021**

The first public version of PocketMine-MP 4 has been released on December 1st, 2021 after years of PocketMine-MP 4 development. This means that PocketMine-MP 3 will be no longer supported after a while. We want to provide the best service for everyone, one of which is by providing an update for a newer PocketMine-MP version before anyone needs it. That's why we starting to update all of our existing plugins to be compatible with PocketMine-MP 4 before the PocketMine-MP 3 official support comes to an end.

Plugins listed below are ready to be used for production servers, but like all software, they may contain minor bugs. If you happen to find one, please submit an issue in the GitHub repository of the plugin you're facing with.
