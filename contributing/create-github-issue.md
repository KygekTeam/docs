title: Creating a GitHub issue
---

**NOTE:** This section is a work on progress. Information might be incomplete or unfinished, however contributions are always welcome.

## DOs

- Before creating a GitHub issue, please **read the plugin README.md and see other GitHub issues** (if exists) to find out whether your issue has been mentioned or warned
- Write a **descriptive title** (e.g. Server crashes when executing command `/example` in console; YAML errors in console when upgrading the plugin from version 1.0.0 to 2.0.0)
- Explain the issue with **formal phrases and words**
- Give information about your **server version and specifications** (at least from the `/version` command)
- If the issue occurs in the server console, **copy and paste** them into your GitHub issue, otherwise if it occurs in the client, **send a screenshot** of it
- Explain **things you have done to attempt solving the issue** by yourself if you have already
- If necessary, attach **a screenshot and/or a video** that reproduces the issue

## DON'Ts

- Creating **duplicated/redundant** GitHub issues (issues that has been mentioned before)
- **Poor usage** of issue **titles** (e.g. Problem; Suggestion; Plugin not working)
- **Unclear or messy** issue **description**
- Possible **lack of information** that requires us to re-ask about your issue (e.g. Server version and operating system; Server console error outputs)
